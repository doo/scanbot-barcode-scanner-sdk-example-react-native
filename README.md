# Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Example Apps for React Native
These example apps demonstrate how to integrate the [Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for React Native](https://scanbot.io/developer/react-native-barcode-scanner/) for Android and iOS.


## What is the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK?

Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is a simple to use high level API, providing a collection of classes and functions for scanning and parsing 1D and 2D barcodes from your mobile device's camera or other image sources like your photo library.

The SDK for React Native is available as an npm package:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk

## Trial License

The Scanbot SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!

After the trial period has expired, all SDK functions and UI components will stop working. You have to restart the app to get another one-minute trial period.

To test the Scanbot SDK without crashing, you can get a free ‚Äúno-strings-attached‚Äù trial license. Please submit the [Trial License Form](https://scanbot.io/trial/) on our website.

## Free Developer Support

We provide free "no-strings-attached" developer support for the implementation & testing of the Scanbot SDK.
If you encounter technical issues with integrating the Scanbot SDK or need advice on choosing the appropriate
framework or features, please visit our [Support Page](https://docs.scanbot.io/support/).

## Documentation

For more details about the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for React Native please see this
[documentation](https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/react-native/introduction/).

## How to run this app

* `npm install`
* `cd ios && pod install`
* `react-native run-ios --device` or `react-native run-android`

- Open the **workspace** file `ScanbotBarcodeExampleReact.xcworkspace` (not .xcodeproj) from the `ios` directory in Xcode.
- Adjust *Provisioning* and *Signing* settings.
- And run the app in Xcode or via `react-native run-ios`.

## Requirements

### Built using

* `react-native-cli` `latest`
* `node` v12.13.0
* `npm` v6.12.0

### What else can go wrong?

###### Pod not found

`pod repo update`

###### Still at a loss? It is probably a cache issue

* `npm cache clean --force`
* Restart metro server! (Yes, apparently that thing has its own cache as well)
